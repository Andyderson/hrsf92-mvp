## Development

> After extensive searching for an API that contained detailed information on allergies, I emailed WebMD/MayoClinic requesting access to their database. Waiting to hear from WebMD as MayoClinic has refused. Thus, the data being used currently is mostly self-written test data!

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install -g webpack
npm install
```
